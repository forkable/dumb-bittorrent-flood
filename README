This code is ancient. :)
Long time ago I was testing if it was possible to slow down my servers by using
public bittorrent trackers. The idea was to go to some public torrent indexing site, 
get the list of most popular torrents, download them, and then announce my server's 
IP address and port to the tracker, making other bittorrent clients make lots of 
requests to my server (thinking it is another client).

While it didn't really make an impact on the performance of my site, it caused
a lot of incoming connections (that were dropped because they were doing bittorrent
handshake).

Even if it didn't slow things down, I found out something interesting.
There were some bittorrent clients making requests long after the IP address was 
removed from the tracker. It seems like there are other bots out there that are 
either making random noise or looking for other torrents you could have loaded in
your clients.
The morale of the story is - watch out when using public bittorrent trackers.

Also, the code was put up together really quickly and looks really messy.
And PHP wasn't really made to do tasks in parallel. :D
